Abstract

This tool uses a simplified model of the EU to simulate and predict the effects of multiple political policies on the spread of the but not only the COVID-19 disease.

There exist several interesting models for epidemiologic disease modeling. We want to use these to create a model which to some degree resembles the European Union. Further, we want to validate and predict the effects of political policies and potentially on the spread of this and other diseases in future epidemics.

This project stands on the shoulders of Fatih Erikli's: https://fatiherikli.github.io/coronavirus-simulation/
